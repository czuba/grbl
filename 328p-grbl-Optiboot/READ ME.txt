You can now burn your atmega328p bootloader with the Arduino IDE ( I used 1.6.12 ) If your running a Nano with 328p chip it will now act like a Uno. (smaller bootloader :) )
The main reason to use this bootloader vs a standard install of optiboot Will be led on pin D13 is no longer going to flash at power up or reset. If you have a relay
with say a spindle attached to D13 the flashing of the led could cause it to turn on before being told to do so with G-code commands. 

I used Arduino as ISP ( changed heart beat delay in isp sketch from 40 to 20 ) and Arduino IDE 1.6.12. This bootloader is for Atmega328P chips.
Use at your own risk. 

Compiled from optiboot source code 6.2 Using the " make LED_START_FLASHES=0 atmega328 " command
